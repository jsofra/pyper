# pyper

The pyed pyper will lead the boys and girls away from their familiar imperative world to a bright new functional world.

## what is it?

Pyper is a wrapper over clojure-py to bring Clojure's immutable persistent data structures to Python in a convenient form.

This is just an initial spike, it doesn't bring alot more to the table than straight clojure-py at this stage.
